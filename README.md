## This will expain the process to create a basic Rotorflight Ethos and FBL setup, the readme.txt file explains the initial setup and presumes a knowledge and understanding of registration and binding of a Frsky Access receiver.

In this example the file and data is based on a Rotorflight Nexus FBL

1. Download the zip file and save to your desktop, unzip the contents.

2. The files include the following:

   Default Ethos diff-all.txt - This is the file to send to the FBL using the CLI 'load from file' option. This will populate the Nexus with the dafult settings.

   Default Ethos Model.bin - This is the Ethos model file and will be copied to the Transmitter SD Card in the models directory

   Default Ethos Readme.txt - This file explains the default configuration once the two files above have been applied.
